* This is a new release.

I have also checked the package with win-devel and there were no additional
errors and warnings. It did note the following about the DESCRIPTION:

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Brms (3:44)
  brms (10:89, 13:40)
  
brms is a package on CRAN and so is not misspelled.
